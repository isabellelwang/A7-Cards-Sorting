What did you notice about the differences in runtime across algorithms as you changed the number of cards you were sorting? If you had to split them into "slower" algorithms vs "faster" algorithms, which would you put in each category?
Faster algorithms include Insertion Sort and Quicksort while slower algorithms are merge sort and selection sort. When the cards are halved, merge sort took the longest while insertion, selection, and quicksort were relatively fast. 

Reflection on your experience with this assignment:
This assignment made me better understand the processes of sorting. I really enjoyed doing insertion and selection sort. Quicksort and Merge sort were on the trickier side, because it had recursive concepts to it. I enjoyed seeing the time of each sorting and comparing which ones are more efficient.
